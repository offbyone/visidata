### What is textpunk?

Textpunk is a computing style that upgrades the classic terminal interface with modern technology (unicode, 256-color, web, etc).

Like steampunk renounces electricity to explore an alternate universe of steam and gears, textpunk abstains from graphics and develops a preference for a keyboard and terminal.

Textpunk is for anyone who loves [vim](http://vim.org), [irssi](http://irssi.org), [tmux](http://tmux.github.io), or [ohmyzsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). (Nethack?)

Beyond aesthetics, these tools can radically streamline your process, if you learn how to use them in your own workflow.

So if you are stuck using a monochrome teletype and you would like to be more efficient and stylish, you might try going a little textpunk.

And if you are even a little textpunk, you will probably feel right at home with [VisiData](http://visidata.org).
