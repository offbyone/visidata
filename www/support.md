# Support VisiData Development

VisiData is an open-source tool that you can install and use for free (under the terms of GPL3).

If you are like me, you work in the trenches of tech, suffering through impedance mismatches, undesigned interfaces, and a glut of libraries and tools of varying quality.
I want to help you focus on your actual work, and not all of the distracting nonsense that has become a huge part of our daily working lives.
Let me take care of the irritating and tedious parts, so you can focus on the job you're actually being paid to do.

The base VisiData utility and library will remain free.  These tools are available for purchase, and proceeds will be used to improve VisiData and the entire ecosystem:

Product|Price|Description
-------|-----|------------------------------------
[VisiData](/)|Free!|the original multitool, for investigative journalists, data engineers, terminal diehards, and anyone who has ever done `grep|cut|awk` with a csv file
[vgit](/vgit)|| for people who want something like magit but don't want to use emacs
vsh|| a collection of standard UNIX utilities with a common interactive interface (vping, vtop)
vdiff| |a diff tool for csv and other tabular data
vscrape || a web scraper for people who need data now, but don't want to write code or sign up for a scraping service
vpy || for Python developers to explore objects and modules with a nicer TUI than the REPL
vsql || a standard TUI for RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc), for people who just want to interact with the data in the database, without a bunch of setup or re-learning the particular nuances of each SQL variant
vstats || VisiData with integrated Pandas, for statisticians who want to crunch data interactively
[vdgalcon]() |Free!| [Galactic Conquest]() in the terminal, with network server
