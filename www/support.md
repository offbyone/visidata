# Support VisiData Development

VisiData is an open-source tool that can be installed and used for free (under the terms of GPL3).

If you are like me, you work in the trenches of tech, suffering through impedance mismatches, undesigned interfaces, and a glut of libraries and tools of varying quality.
I want to help you focus on [your] actual work, and not all of the distracting nonsense that has become a huge part of [our] daily working lives.(I like the gist of both of these sentences, but I would like to experiment with alternatives ways of phrasing them.)

The base VisiData utility and library will remain free.  The following tools can be licensed are available for purchase, and proceeds will be used to improve VisiData and the entire ecosystem:

Product|Version|Price|Description
-------|------|-----|------------------------------------
[VisiData](/)|v1.0|Free!|the original multitool, for investigative journalists, data scientists, terminal diehards, and anyone else who has ever done `grep|cut|sort -k` on a csv file
[vgit](/vgit)|v0.3||if you want something like [magit]() but don't use emacs
vsql |coming soon| a standard TUI for RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc), when you just want to interact with the database, without a bunch of setup or re-learning the nuances of that particular SQL variant
vstats |under consideration| VisiData with integrated Pandas, for statisticians who want to crunch data interactively
vscrape |under consideration| a web scraper for when you need data now, but don't want to write code or sign up for a scraping service
vsh|v0.1|| a collection of standard UNIX utilities with a common interactive interface (vping, vtop)
[vdgalcon]() |v0.9|Free!| [Galactic Conquest]() in the terminal, with network server.  Made during a 48-hour Game Jam while at the Recurse Center.
