# VisiData documentation

* VisiData's [manpage](/man) contains a comprehensive quick reference of all global and sheet-specific commands.

* The [system tests](/test) provide examples of how VisiData's atomic commands can be combined for complex workflows.

* [CONTRIBUTING.md](/contributing) contains information on how to contribute to VisiData's ongoing development.

* There are a few VisiData [demo videos](/videos).  Please post an issue or send an email if there are any features in particular you want to know about.

## For developers

The dream is for VisiData to be able to interact with data from any source or in any format.

Creating a loader for a new data source is easy and usually takes only an hour or two.  It's fun and rewarding to create a great terminal interface for your favorite data source.

VisiData [supports many different file formats and data sources](/man#loaders).  It would be fantastic to find devs interested in creating interfaces for other data sources.
